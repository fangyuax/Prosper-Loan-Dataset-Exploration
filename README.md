# Prosper-Loan-Dataset-Exploration
## Dataset

> Prosper Loan dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Most of the data is numeric, and there is some data type is datetime. Some variables such as CreditGrade, LoanStatus are ordered factor variables with the following levels.

## Summary of Findings

> The Prosper Loan Dataset gives many different perspectives on borrowing. By processing data, visualizing data and analyzing different graphs, we can discover the background of borrowers, and the extend of their credit grade and prosper rate affect the amount of their loan amount and the level of interest rate. In general, credit grade and prosper rate greatly affect the amount of borrowers and the interest rate.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Some ordinal variables would be messed up when visualizing the data, and some code is needed to display the correct order in the plots. Also, some data I thought would be related, such as the income of borrowers would affect their original loan amount, but after visualizing the data, no obvious trend was found.
